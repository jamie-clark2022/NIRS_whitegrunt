Predicting fish age with Near-Infrared spectroscopy

Goals for this code is to...
1) change spectral files from OPUS to .spc
2) create list of spectral file names
3) brings in absorbance measurements at wavelength data for each file
4) bring in meta data
5) create matrix of file name with absorbance measrurements and meta data
6) plot spectra per age
7) create PCA
8) create PLS
