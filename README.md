Predicting fish age with Near-Infrared spectroscopy

Goals for this code are to...
1) change spectral files from OPUS to .spc
2) create list of spectral file names
3) bring in absorbance measurements at wavelength data for each sample
4) bring in meta data
5) create matrix to merge absorbance measrurements with meta data per sample
6) plot spectra per age
7) create PCA
8) create PLS
